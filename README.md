# project gyeoul: integrative-complexity

## Project Objectives
This will involve taking a entire user's posting history on twitter (subject to change as I know this is not the most optimal data source considering the character limits), and be able to give a user a particular IC score from 1 to 7, along with gathering data to train a ML model to better determine someone's score.
